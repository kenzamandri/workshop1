    <h2>OUR MISSION AND VISION</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>WE EMPOWER YOUNG PEOPLE TO BECOME ENGAGED AND EFFECTIVE CITIZENS.
      </p>

      <p>GENERATION CITIZEN (GC) WORKS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IN THE UNITED STATES RECEIVES AN EFFECTIVE ACTION CIVICS EDUCATION, WHICH PROVIDES THEM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AS ACTIVE CITIZENS. GENERATION CITIZENâ€™S ACTION CIVICS CURRICULUM IS THE CRUX OF OUR WORK AND OF BOTH OUR DEMOCRACY COACH-LED AND TEACHER-LED MODELS. THE CURRICULUM IS ACTION-BASED, ALIGNED TO RELEVANT STANDARDS, AND ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS. WE ENVISION A COUNTRY OF YOUNG PEOPLE WORKING AS ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE CITIZENS TO COLLECTIVELY REBUILD OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.
