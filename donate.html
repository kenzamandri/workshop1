      <p>Help support Generation Citizen Programming
      </p>

      <p>This year, Generation Citizen celebrates the fifth anniversary of its incorporation as a nonprofit. Since first launching in Providence, RI, over 20,000 middle and high school students have developed the skills they need to drive change in their communities and make democracy work. More than 1,200 college volunteer Democracy Coaches have devotedly ensured that the voices of young people are heard. They are proving that action civics leads to real change. But there is much work to be done. Please consider a gift to support the next five years of meaningful civic engagement by sponsoring a GC school, college chapter, classroom or student.
